# My React App

Demo app to learn some React.

## Goals
* Make some CRUD screens
* Link to a DB
* Do some paging
* Some sort of menu

## Stretch Goals
* Add authentication

## Requirements

Install AdventureWorks db from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15

## Notes

So I thought I would be using Axios to get data. Don't need to as can just use fetch().

## Tasks

1. ~~Make a menu tree thing for AdventureWorks Categories and Subcategories.~~
2. ~~List products for a given Subcategory~~
3. Edit products
4. Validation, client and server side

## Review
* Visual Studio is very slow starting up. Should the project be split out to client side / server side projects? Switch off SPA stuff?

## Questions and next steps
* How do you do locally scoped css like Vue.js?
* How to secure API calls?
